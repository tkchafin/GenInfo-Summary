# GenInfo-Summary
Simple Python program which parses a table containing NCBI GI numbers and outputs summary tables of taxonomic representation at various ranks (e.g., Family)

My use case involved large magicblast tabular outputs where I took sets of reads which didn't align to my target organism reference genome, and I was looking for hits against a local refseq-genomic database to try and figure out what sort of off-target stuff I was sequencing (contamination etc), but the code should be usable for any case in which you have a table having NCBI GI numbers.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3
* Pandas

## Usage 
Details coming later. Code is in development currently.
